# Project 11 - Optimizing a site for performance

Apply the skills you've learned for optimization of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized page and reduce the total load size to under 1.3MB. You will need to analyze the assets you've been provided to see where optimizations can and need to be made, make those optimizations, and measure their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles may be required.
